Welcome to EcoHome! In this tutorial, we will show you how to be environmentally friendly in your own home.

Well done!

Let me show you the basic controls.

Use the left joystick to move around.

Use the right joystick to rotate.

In front of you, you can see a piece of paper. Use the grip button to pick it up.

Try to throw the paper into the trashbin.

Well done! In the next room, you will see different kinds of waste. You have to dispose of them correctly. There is a trashbin for paper, glass, plastic, tin cans and biological waste. Try to seperate the waste correctly.

Light and electric devices should be turned off when they are not in use. Turn them off using the trigger buttons by aiming and clicking on the light switch and screens.

You can turn off electric devices using the trigger button.

Well done! Prove your skills by completing the next room by yourself.

Splendid! A classic gathering place is the kitchen, and that leaves traces. Tidy up the room and bring it into an orderly state. Also, it seems that the faucet is not completely turned off. Water is an important resource that should not be wasted.

Congratulations! You have finished the tutorial. If you'd like, you may now challenge your throwing skills or return to the main menu to start or leave the game.
